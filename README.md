# operations on fabonacci series

# what  is the project ?
  - fabonacci series is a common series with different usages.
  - The project has 2 sections : 
  - first : last_digit_of_fabonacci_number : to get the last digit in fabonacci number with fast algorithm, with no need to calculate the all fabonacci number.
  - second : Fabonacci_series_naive_and_fast : to get fabonacci number of a number , user input with slow (naive) and fast (enhanced) ways.

# How to implement it ?
- you can implement it in many ways , first the online implementaion , from [here](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler), by copying the code and run it in the attached page.
- or you can download editor with c++ compiler such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) , or [code blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads) to run the project.
